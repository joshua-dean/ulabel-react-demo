# ULabel React Demo
Demonstration of using 
[ULabel](https://github.com/SenteraLLC/ulabel)
in a 
[React](https://react.dev/)
project.


## Usage
WIP



## Development Process
This project was bootstrapped with
```bash
npx create-react-app ulabel-react-demo
```
ULabel was installed with
```bash
npm install ulabel
```

The ULabel component was added by taking existing "on load"
functionality from the ULabel demo and putting it in a single
[`useEffect` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect).
